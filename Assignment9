// 1. Carefully observe this example.
// a) Is the InnerFunction() a closure?
Yes it is a Closure

// b) What is output of this program
/* function OuterFunction()
// { var outerVariable = 100;
function InnerFunction() {
alert(outerVariable);
}
return InnerFunction;
}
var innerFunc = OuterFunction();
innerFunc();   */

Output: 100

//2. What is the difference between a closure and a scope?
    The accessiblity of a object or a variable is within the function in which it declared.
    When we declare a function within a function, the inner function is called as closure.
    
// 3. What is a lexical scope and how is it related to closure?
    Closure is the nesting of functions and the inner funtions will have the ability to access
the variables declared in outer functions which is called the lexical scope.

/* 4. Output of following closure ?
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
setTimeout(function log() {
console.log(i); // What is logged?
}, 1000);
} */

Output:
Takes time of 1 second and print the below
