// 1. Are Higher Order functions and Call back functions the same ? If not,
//briefly explain about both functions.
Higher order and call back functions are not same
Higher order functions can receive a function as an argument and can return a function as value
Call back functions are those which passed to other function

// 2. Is filter a Higher Order function in Javascript ? If yes, why ?
Yes filter is a Higher order function in JS because it returns a new data structure but using the given data structure

// 3. Give an example of a Higher Order function and a call back function used in the same program.
const names= ['John', 'Tina','Kale','Max']
function useFunction(arr,fn){
for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
fn(arr[i]);
}
}
function argFn (name){
console.log("Hello " + name );
}
useFunction(names,argFn);

In the above example useFunction is a Higher Order function and arfFn is call back function
